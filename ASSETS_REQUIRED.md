## Implementation Notes

1. **Image Files**: Place all images in `/frontend/public/images/` directory
2. **Audio Files**: Place all audio files in `/frontend/public/audio/` directory
3. **Format Recommendations**:
   - Images: SVG format for scalability and accessibility
   - Audio: MP3 format for broad browser support
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure all images have proper alt text and audio narration is clear
5. **TTS Integration**: Audio files can be generated using the existing TTS service at `/backend/python_services/tts_gen.py`

## Next Steps

1. Create or source the 15 image files
2. Generate 75 audio files using TTS service or record them
3. Place files in appropriate public directories
4. Test each question with image and audio playback
5. Ensure accessibility features work correctly
